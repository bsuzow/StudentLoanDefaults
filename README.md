# Student Loan Defaults (work-in-progress)

Student loan debt (SLD) total in the US reached a staggering number in 1.5 trillion dollars, borrowed by 44 million people. It is `r round(1480/620,1)` times larger than the total of credit card debt.  The SLD total in 2008 was 640 billion dollars [which ballooned to 1.2 trillion by 2015](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/14/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-student-loan-debt-has-doubled-under-obama/). While the importance and value of higher education (HED) can never be marginalized, student loans accumulated for financing higher education are reported as societal issues such as [reasons for divorce](https://www.yahoo.com/amphtml/finance/news/millennial-marriages-crumbling-student-loan-debt-134145853.html), financial dependence on parents, and lack of home ownership observed in Gen-Y.  

In order for an student to be able to pay off HED loans, the loan total should not exceed his/her annual income from gainful employment the HED would provide.  For unfortunate some, this rule of thumb was violated and loan defaults resulted.
